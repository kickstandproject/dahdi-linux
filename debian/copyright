This package was debianized by Matt Zimmerman <mdz@debian.org> on
Mon, 17 Jun 2002 10:31:21 -0400.

It was downloaded from
  http://downloads.asterisk.org/pub/telephony/dahdi-linux/

The DAHDI-extra patch was generated from the repository:
  http://git.tzafrir.org.il/?p=dahdi-extra.git;a=summary
  http://git.tzafrir.org.il/git/dahdi-extra.git

Upstream source has been modified to comply with the Debian Free 
Software Guildlines (DFSG), by the removal of the firmware files:

    drivers/dahdi/xpp/firmwares/*.hex

drivers/dahdi/xpp/firmwares/LICENSE.firmware permits redistribution but
does not mention modification, which is a requirement of Debian Policy
2.1 ("Derived works").


Summary:
The bulk of the code, under drivers/dahdi/ , is licensed under the terms
of GPLv2. Various drivers (e.g.: all non-Digium drivers) are licensed as
GPLv2.+ . Two other files (mmx.h, XppConfig.pm) are licensed under a more
permissive license.
